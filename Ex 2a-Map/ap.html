                Kuchipudi, the cultural dance recognised as the official dance form of the state of Andhra Pradesh, originated in the village of Kuchipudi in Krishna district. Many composers of Carnatic music like Annamacharya, Kshetrayya, Tyagaraja, and Bhadrachala Ramadas were of Telugu descent. The Telugu film industry hosted many music composers and playback singers, such as Ghantasala, S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, P. Susheela, S. Janaki, and P. B. Sreenivas. Harikathaa Kalakshepam (or Harikatha) involves the narration of a story, intermingled with various songs relating to the story.Burra katha is an oral storytelling technique in which the topic is either a Hindu mythological story or a contemporary social issue. It lost its sheen due to poor patronage.
